- Natural **Radiation** on [Mars](https://marspedia.org/Mars "Mars") is much higher compared with [Earth](https://marspedia.org/Earth "Earth"). The thin [atmosphere](https://marspedia.org/Atmosphere "Atmosphere") provides only a small shielding effect against [cosmic radiation](https://marspedia.org/Cosmic_radiation "Cosmic radiation"). It provides moderate protection against [solar radiation](https://marspedia.org/Solar_radiation "Solar radiation"). Mars also lacks the [magnetosphere](https://marspedia.org/Magnetosphere "Magnetosphere") that protects Earth.

The average natural radiation level on Mars is 24-30 rads or 240-300 mSv per year[[1]](https://marspedia.org/Radiation#cite_note-:0-1)[[2]](https://marspedia.org/Radiation#cite_note-:5-2). This is about 40-50 times the average on Earth.
